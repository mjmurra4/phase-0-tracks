Strategy for Researching jQuery

1. Get very high level overview
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery
2. figure out what it is intended to do.
- Some practical uses: https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/the-20-most-practical-and-creative-uses-of-jquery--net-2523
3. find jquery's limitations
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/110533/what-are-jquerys-limitations
4. find resources like cheetsheets

For me to grasp concepts best, I need to understand how people use it (and when to avoid it) in the real world. So approaching this with finding some real world examples and then starting to think about how I can use it, is the best approach for me.
