Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?
	- Data structures organize lots of items (strings, integers, etc…) into a much more manageable fashion.

Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.
	- arrays are a good way to organized lists in ruby

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
	- Any list of a similar type of object is a good fit for arrays. A list of math problems and answers, or a list of presidents would be good for arrays.

Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
	- A hash is a data structure similar to an array. It’s better for something like a form, where there is a list of dissimilar items.

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
	- Forms are the easiest examples. Filling out information at the dentists’ office, or if you are paying for something where you have to input a name, payment method billing address etc..

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?
	- iteration is useful because you can take a large collection of items that you can perform a task on each individual item.

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
	- Someone drinking beer would be a repeatable task that could require iteration .
Blocks
8. What is a block?
	-Kind of like a method, blocks are code that you can run repeatedly and it does a task over and over again.

9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
 	- A block parameter is the value that is being used by the block. It’s value comes from the method being called.
