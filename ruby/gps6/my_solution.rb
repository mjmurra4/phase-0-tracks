# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# We spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
#require_relative allows code to access another ruby document using a relative file path rather than an absolute file path as with require.

require_relative 'state_data'

# Reflection Section
#There is a nested hash within a hash
# require_relative is used when the two files are within the same folder
#You can iterate through the keys, or the values.
#In this case with a nested hash iterating through the values means iterating through the nested hashes
#It was interesting to me how iteration through the value was able to save a lot of code
# Learning to iterate through nested hashes was super helpful. I feel much more confident with hashes now
