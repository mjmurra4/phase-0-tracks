	<h3> But I'm not a Panthers fan; why should I like this team?</h3>
	<p> Great question! Here is a non-exhaustive list of reason why the Carolina Panthers should be your team:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Look at Cam's Smiling face</li>
		<li>Panthers are really cool! The colors are really great too</li>
		<li>They are good! Hop on bandwagoners!</li>

	<p> This page is vaguely similar to this <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamisond/15-reasons-why-the-carolina-panthers-should-be-you-7fxd?utm_term=.ohBn5GxY00#.mlblQvoV44">Buzzfeed</a> page Looking at the page source, Buzzfeed uses a lot of the meta tag which appears to be for machine tracking that won't show up on the site. Which I imagine is pretty useful for a site like Buzzfeed which needs to track a lot of information, from authors to clicks. If there is anything bad here, it seems like they have thousands of lines of code just dedicated to advertising, which is a little annoying to look at, but obviously important to Buzzfeed. </p>
